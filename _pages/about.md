Welcome to my webpage! I am a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the [University of Thessaly (UTH)](https://www.uth.gr/), and a member of the [CSL](https://csl.e-ce.uth.gr/) group. My career spans both high-level academic and industrial research in Greece and the United States. Previously, I was an Principal Staff Engineer at Motorola Labs in Chicago.

My research focuses on the architecture of computing systems, with a particular emphasis on the synergy between hardware and software. My latest research is on improving the compute efficiency at the node level using ML techniques. In the past (1999-2007), I have worked on multimedia architecture and hardware efficiency for cellular telephones. I have served as the architect for a scalable, programmable architecture designed for MPEG4 video and JPEG image compression, and he designed a programmable Motion Estimation module with a defined Instruction Set Architecture. As a Chief Architect, he designed two ASIC chips dedicated to image processing for wireless multimedia applications intended for next-generation camera-enabled Motorola phones. 

I earned a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 1999. I had previously earned an M.S. from UIUC and a Diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University Of Patras (1992). I have 10 US patents.
