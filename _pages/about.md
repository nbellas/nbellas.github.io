# Nikolaos Bellas

[cite_start]I am a **Professor** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of Thessaly**, Greece[cite: 16]. [cite_start]My career spans both high-level academic research and significant industrial leadership in the United States[cite: 16, 27].

## 🔬 Research Interests
My research focuses on the architectural design of computing systems, specifically:
* [cite_start]**Hardware-Software Co-design**: ML for system design, reconfigurable systems, and heterogeneous architectures[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Energy-Efficiency & Reliability**: Low-power design, approximate computing, and reliable computing substrates[cite: 12, 14].
* [cite_start]**System Software**: EDA tools for architectural synthesis and software support for modern accelerators[cite: 14].

## 💼 Background
[cite_start]Before joining the University of Thessaly, I spent several years at **Motorola Inc.** in Schaumburg, IL, as a **Principal Staff Engineer**[cite: 27]. [cite_start]During my tenure there, I served as the technical lead for reconfigurable computing teams and was the chief architect for image-processing ASIC chips used in Motorola’s early camera-enabled mobile devices[cite: 28, 30].

[cite_start]I hold a **Ph.D.** and an **M.Sc.** in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**[cite: 51, 54].
