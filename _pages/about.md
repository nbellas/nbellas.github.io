Welcome to my webpage! I am a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the [University of Thessaly (UTH)](https://www.uth.gr/), and a member of the [CSL](https://csl.e-ce.uth.gr/) group. My career spans both high-level academic and industrial research in Greece and the United States. Previously, I was an Principal Staff Engineer at Motorola Labs in Chicago. 

My research focuses on the architecture of computing systems, with a particular emphasis on the synergy between hardware and software. My latest research is on improving the compute efficiency at the node level using ML techniques. In the past, I have worked on building architectures for multimedia platforms. I earned a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 1999. I had previously earned an M.S. from UIUC and a Diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University Of Patras (1992). I have 10 US patents. 

## 🔬 Research Interests
My research focuses on the architectural design of computing systems, specifically:
**Hardware-Software Co-design**: ML for system design, reconfigurable systems, and heterogeneous architectures[cite: 12].
**Energy-Efficiency & Reliability**: Low-power design, approximate computing, and reliable computing substrates[cite: 12, 14].
**System Software**: EDA tools for architectural synthesis and software support for modern accelerators[cite: 14].
