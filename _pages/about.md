Welcome to my webpage! I am a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the [University of Thessaly (UTH)](https://www.uth.gr/), and a member of the [CSL](https://csl.e-ce.uth.gr/) group. Previously, I was an Principal Staff Engineer at Motorola Labs in Chicago. My career spans both academic and industrial research in Greece and the United States. 

My research focuses on the architectural design of computing systems, with a particular emphasis on the synergy between hardware and software. My current work explores the intersection of machine learning and systems design, leveraging ML techniques to optimize compute efficiency at the Edge-Cloud continuum. This includes developing intelligent resource management and automated architectural exploration for high-performance, energy-constrained environments. In the past (1999-2007), I have worked on multimedia architectures and hardware efficiency for cellular telephones. I have served as architect for a scalable, programmable architecture designed for MPEG4 video and JPEG image compression, and also designed ASIC chips dedicated to image processing for wireless multimedia applications intended for next-generation camera-enabled phones.I was technical lead of a team working on reconfigurable computing and designed CAD tool that compiles streaming applications written in a high level language to accelerators in a System On FPGA platform.

I earned a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 1999. I had previously earned an M.S. from UIUC and a Diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University Of Patras (1992). I hold 10 US Patents in the areas of computer architecture and embedded systems.
